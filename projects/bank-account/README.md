### Modeling a bank account

Write a program that creates an `account` object with the following characteristics:

* A `name` property.
* A `balance` property set to 0.
* A `deposit` method adding the (positive or negative) value passed as an argument to the account balance.
* A `describe` method returning the account description.
* A `transfer` method with two paramethers: the name of the account that will receive the transfer, and the amount of money to transfer. 

## Test

- Give each of the accounts a deposity on money
- Print a string describing the current amount of money on each account
- Transfer positive values between Billy and Jack and negative values between Rosie and Jack

# Extra
