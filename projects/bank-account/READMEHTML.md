### Practice using HTML with your Bank Account

The look and feel of your bank account is up to you, but make sure that you practice this options:

* Insert an element after or before other element.
* Replace an element (for example each time someone do a transfer).
* Remove an element (if someone does a transfer in negative, how do you update the value of the balance).
* - do some validation so if the balance reaches 0, alert "not enough balance"
* Show or hide an element (if someone doesn't have "money" hide the transfer money button).
* Add .addEventListener() to your buttons
* - add alert "transfer complete!" or "transfer inabled. insufficient funds"
* Select an element or list of elements
* - maybe change a color for something using querySelector. balance changes to red when negative, and green when positive

## Test
- At this point your buttons, list or forms should work with your JS file. If you want to prove your Event Listeners please add `console.log` method to them

# Extra
- Can you thing how Toggle an element should work?
